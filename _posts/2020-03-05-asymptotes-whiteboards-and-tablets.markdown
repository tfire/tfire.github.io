# The asymptote of tech convenience, or how whiteboards are better than tablets
&nbsp;

Here’s a thought.
&nbsp;

An asymptotic curve models the relationship for the rate of added usefulness of consumer computer technology over time, where consumer computer technology is anything that makes you or your life more *androidic.* I’m talking about any technologies you use that have a computerized component versus technologies that are analog (plain paper, a whiteboard, a pencil; these are also technologies, which people seem to forget).
&nbsp;

Consider the real genesis of *consumer computer technology* to be a personal computer made available sometime like 1976. Now evolved significantly. Laptops, tablets, phones.
&nbsp;

Your cell phone is the heart of your androidic self, at least until Neuralink gets embedded in your brain, but that’s too dystopian for this short post.
&nbsp;

As the ‘rate of added usefulness’ of consumer technologies approaches zero, it crosses a threshold that implies a drop-off of the level of smooth dynamic interaction between the user and the tech. Human intuition and flow become invalidated by unnecessary conveniences. Using something over-engineered makes you worse off.
&nbsp;

This is why working on a physical whiteboard will always hold its own steady advantages.
&nbsp;

All of these things are tools. You wouldn’t use a hammer to paint a wall.
&nbsp;

And stop rebuilding the wheel, would you!?
