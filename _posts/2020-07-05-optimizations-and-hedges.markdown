# Optimizations and hedges
&nbsp;

*Preface*
&nbsp;

Sunday afternoon, July 5, the year is two thousand and twenty. I write this from vim.
&nbsp;

Somehow, some time has passed since my last writing .. in this place, particularly.
&nbsp;

I am thinking today about prioritization. Human has hard time with prioritization. Computer has easy time.
&nbsp;

Computer just needs number. Higher number, higher priority. But where does number come from?
&nbsp;

Human .. most probably.
&nbsp;

If human tags tasks with number for computer, why would not human tag for himself?
&nbsp;

*Body*
&nbsp;

I sat down here with a swirling list of tasks in my head, none of them particularly mandatory, all of them of some level of personal importance. They occupy my headspace, have been occupying my headspace, and need to be sorted out.
&nbsp;

Step 1. List them.
&nbsp;

Layer 1 Bullets. Complete sentences are wrong, truly incorrect, faulty behavior. Just bullets. Just a list of bullets, everything that comes to mind, every reminder, every piece of media to consume, every personal concern and its addressing by some half-formed and yet-to-be coalesced solution. These things are floating and must be listed, in bullets, no indentation. Exhaustively, list. Empty your mind; cathartic.
&nbsp;

Step 2. Expand them.
&nbsp;

Layer N Bullets. Subbullets. Indented bullets. Indents in indents. Each of the Layer 1 bullets blooms. Deeper considerations are made, and considerations upon those considerations, and further considerations still.
&nbsp;

Step 3. Filter them.
&nbsp;

With an expanse of considerations now formed, apply a priority filter. Analyze each. Assuming sufficient personal framework exists, weed Layer 1 for immediate value. Cut away the superfluous, trim like fat. Life is a gamble, we bet with our time.
&nbsp;

Step 4. Number them.
&nbsp;

Assuming a yet-higher resolution personal framework, prioritize them. Optimize for financial return, or optimize for time return. Optimize for curiosity, or for utility. Discover synergy. Hedges are not mutually exclusive outcomes. I have used three discrete integers: 1, 2, & 3.
