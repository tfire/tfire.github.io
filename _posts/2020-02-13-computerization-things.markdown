# On the computerization of Things, or the thin line between novel/bauble
&nbsp;

A war wages in the inner hearts & minds of the tech world. The war between novel ideas and bauble ideas.
&nbsp;

My infinite fascination with embedded computers stems from a childhood tearing apart any object that had a circuitboard in it, collecting bins full of electronic components that had been put to the guillotine as a result of my intrigue.
&nbsp;

As I've gotten older, I've gotten wiser, more contemplative, and I can't help but to stop and ponder the line between really useful embedded things, and embedded things you'd see in HBO's Silicon Valley - like changing the world with a computer fridge.
&nbsp;

I mean no disrespect to anyone that seeks to change the world with computer fridges, smart homes, smart clothes, and so on.
&nbsp;

Just not my cup of tea. I don't care to work as the means to an end of more needless consumer dainties. Sometimes it feels like technology for technology's sake. And I'm more interested in the arc of what these millions, billions of connected devices implicate, what kinds of threats and opportunities they pose, for rogue hackers and industrial data scientists alike.
&nbsp;

In trying to conceive of some really *novel* ideas, I've stumbled upon this thin line holding up the novel/bauble dichotomy.
&nbsp;

Consumer IoT has been by far the hardest area to ideate in non-bauble ideas. I believe the asymptote of convenience-worth-pursuing is readily approaching zero. There are undoubtedly the really useful and impactful things, namely iPhones and electric cars, perhaps health trackers, but beyond that, what do we have that is so irresistibly utilizable that it represents a major advancement in individual capabilities? Alexa listening in. Fridges, infotainment units, and gas pumps all with touch screens and embedded advertising. Contribution to or plague upon society?
&nbsp;

I mean, Consumer *Things* are pretty much just that -- baubles. You could take it or leave it. So what else?
&nbsp;

What about Industrial Things? Here there's more imaginative ground to be had. We can conceive of many possibilities in industrial IoT. Supply chain, manufacturing, energy, oil and gas. Putting sensors online. Data collection, data science, edge computing. I don't see an overlap in edge computing and consumer refrigerators. Factory robots and oil rigs? Moreso. Saving waste, saving energy, making existing processes that *society already depends on* more efficient, economic, and ecofriendly - well, that's a worthy pursuit, I say.
&nbsp;

Problems like these are pursuits of infrastructural innovation. Contributing to the tech involved in energy and material pipelines by devising ways to preserve resources. Doing your part to be *actually* useful. Save a company capital by preventing waste and spillage, they'll be on board. Business is an equation; just be on the right side of it.
&nbsp;

Are you a computer engineer also looking for meaningful problems? There's a third thing that consistently comes to mind which transcends either side of the consumer/inustrial coin: security. Huge necessity. Super interesting. Be the good guy and the bad guy at once. More about this later.
