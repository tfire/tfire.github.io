# How am I just now finding out about Github Pages?
&nbsp;

I mean, honestly, this couldn't get any better.
&nbsp;

I have been looking for this exact solution with these exact benefits in a blogging platform for years. Around the block, from SquareSpace to Wordpress to trials in 100% roll-your-own cloud server with Apache -- web dev frameworks be damned (sorry). Posts written and long lost over the years, but no more. We have found permanence.
&nbsp;

Why am I exuberant with GitHub Pages? I'll tell you.
&nbsp;

- [git push] to put a new post on the blog.
- writing from vim. What can I say, I capture links & notes in the terminal.
- writing from anywhere with ssh access.
- all the formatting is in easy markdown.
- big possibility to write tools that streamline generating post templates.
- extremely fast & lightweight static pages thanks to [Jekyll][jekyll-docs].
- awesome minimalist theme that was effortless to adopt.

&nbsp;

This hugely boils down to being able to write and maneuver from a shell. When you can get to the point that you're faster with vim shortcuts and command aliases than you can ever be with a mouse pointer and a wordpress gui, you'll know the satisfaction of writing blog posts as a shell power user.
&nbsp;

And would you just look at the built in highlighting?

&nbsp;

{% highlight python %}
def digital_root(n):
    return n % 9
{% endhighlight %}

&nbsp;
Going to go migrate some posts from Wordpress now.
This is the future. Farewell, 2008.
