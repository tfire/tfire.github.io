# Know code but no code, or knowing how to code is not the end but the means
&nbsp;

The name of the game (the game being advantageously useful technology) is problem solving, not computer coding. Here at the top of the stack we have abstracted away the process of writing useful code so much so that it is a huge waste of time to rebuild things that have already been achieved — not to mention achieved more effectively by someone more knowledgeable than you.
&nbsp;

The interfacing between these independently built puzzle pieces, tools, and platforms is really quite doable but anybody who hasn’t been exposed to object oriented concepts or even simple **for** loops would have not even the slightest chance at assembling Apache Spark and an AWS instance together by themselves.
&nbsp;

Catch 22: You *must* know how to code, yet you won’t need to.
