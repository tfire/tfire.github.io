# Consult then build a product, or build a product then consult? 
&nbsp;

This question has crossed my mind tonight.
&nbsp;

The issue with consulting is that there is no intense, exponential economy of scale. Have you ever heard of a consulting empire? 
&nbsp;

The upside is that it's multi-flavored and always new. Every day presents another novel opportunity.
&nbsp;

If you were to build a product in a niche, you would learn a great deal through this process.
&nbsp;

If you were to consult in the same niche, you would learn a great deal through that process as well.
&nbsp;

Which would be more advantageous, or even possible, to do first?
&nbsp;

Well, here's one observation: consulting, by virtual necessity, requires field expertise -- from the start.
&nbsp;

Building is trial and error, pivoting and learning, sandboxing and playing around.
&nbsp;

Consulting requires reputation.
&nbsp;

Building requires determination.
&nbsp;

The only way to be a truly reputed & credentialed consultant would be to have built something wildly successful in the past.
&nbsp;

The only way to be a successful builder is to get started.
