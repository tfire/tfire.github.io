# Business science 
And how efficiency is moral
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

# *Preface*
&nbsp;

I once had this peculiar phase of thought in which I decided that being efficient was no longer the most important thing, or rather,
no longer as important as simply being effective. I decided effectiveness was more important than efficiency. And to some extent,
this is the case. For example, in a taking on of a qualitative objective, efficiency is good, generally, but doesn't *have* to be maximized.
&nbsp;

In a quantitative objective, one should maximize efficiency. Absolute. There is no reason not to -- even taking into account doing things metaefficiently. The time it take
to build a solution to a problem may require a larger commitment of time than doing it manually. This is a metaefficiency. 
This kind of problem space is all too small and human, all too human.
&nbsp;

But there are many problems that are too big to be human-metaefficient. They are well beyond the scope of a simple and direct objective that can be
reached easily within the limitations of a single body. 
&nbsp;

# *Efficiency is aesthetic and moral*
&nbsp;

We cannot seem to collectively agree "I think, therefore I am" is a sufficient starting point. But I offer this as a starting point! -- your time is limited.
Your human life will end. This is an uncomfortable bio-logical truth you *cannot*, actually, deny. If you enjoy a good life full with loving family, peace, strength, and beauty,
then time matters to you. If you don't share this enjoyment, and actually resent it, then time does not matter to you, and you resent *time* too. You are as Good as dead. So many despisers!
&nbsp;

Time is valuable because it matters, then we should use what is valuable *efficiently.*   
&nbsp;


# *Coin phrases, not tokens*
&nbsp;

I am coining a term tonight: business science. This isn't no MBA.
&nbsp;

The etymology of business. Sense of "a person's work, occupation, that which one does for a livelihood" late 14c. (in late Old English bisig (adj.) appears as a noun with the sense "occupation, state of employment"). Sense of "that which is undertaken as a duty" late 14c. Meaning "what one is about at the moment" is from 1590s. Sense of "trade, commercial engagements, mercantile pursuits collectively" is first attested 1727, on the notion of "matters which occupy one's time and attention."
&nbsp;

The etymmology of efficiency. 1590s, "power to accomplish something," from Latin efficientia "efficient power; efficiency; influence" In mechanics, "ratio of useful work done to energy expended," from 1858.
&nbsp;

The etyomology of science. From late 14c. in English as "a particular branch of knowledge or of learning;" also "skillfulness, cleverness; craftiness." From c. 1400 as "experiential knowledge;" also "a skill, handicraft; a trade." 
&nbsp;

Business, matters which occupy one's time. Time which has value, value which represents an expense. Efficiency, a ratio of useful work done to energy expended. Science, a branch of knowledge, a craftiness.
&nbsp;

Business science can be said to be a *craftiness with the matters which occupy one's time and attention.* 
&nbsp;

These things together make up the idea at stake. As someone once said, a business organization is a cybernetic coalition.
In the realm of cybernetics, the concept of a feedback loop is core. Feedback is the process by which some agent gives an input,
and then receives an output back to him. Or maybe he gives output and receives input. Same difference. Do you see?
&nbsp;

Feedback loops operate on time as energy. The time it takes for a feedback loop to complete is the precursor to a measurable efficiency ratio. (useful work done / energy expended)
&nbsp;

During a loop, some arbitrarily useful work is done with some amount of time required. You want the ratio to be as high as possible, that is,
total usefulness over time expended. Maximize the ratio in two simultaneous ways: 1) target work with the most usefulness (pump the numerator). 2) improve the efficiency of that work. (slash the denominator) 
&nbsp; 

Target the *most useful* feedback loops, and reduce their time to completion.
&nbsp;
