# Who is Tyler Feuerstein?

A child prodigy Flash game mischief-maker turned computer scientist & guitar player. I have a B.S. in computer science from the University of Michigan. Currently I work as an embedded software engineer. I'm interested in embedded and distributed computer infrastructure, also music hardware like synthesizers and other cool toys.

# What is tfire?

The German last name gives most people trouble. Just imagine what it's like for me making reservations. Say *`fire-stine`*, that's the Americanized way. Say *foyer-shtein*, that's the authentic German way.

A long time ago this catchy nickname was coined.
