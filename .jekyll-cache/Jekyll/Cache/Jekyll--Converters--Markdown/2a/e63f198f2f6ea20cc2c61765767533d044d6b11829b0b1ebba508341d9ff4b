<p>The German last name gives most people trouble. Just imagine what itâ€™s like for me making reservations. A long time ago this catchy nickname was coined. Say <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">fire-stine</code></em>, thatâ€™s the Americanized way. Say <em>foyer-shtein</em>, thatâ€™s the authentic German way.</p>
